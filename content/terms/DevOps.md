DevOps is the collaboration between operations and development teams within an organization to achieve shorter development cycles and greater product reliability.
It is the idea that in each stage of an application lifecycle each team has a shared responsbility. This is an ongoing cycle that continues even after the application has  been released.

## Example

> My IT team and software development team will bridge the gap between roles by working together as one unit to share accountability for each stage of the development
lifecycle. They will work together through collaboration and automation to build, test, and deploy applications at a higher velocity.
