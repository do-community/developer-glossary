A comment is a portion of text that you put into the source code of a computer program to help explain what is happening in that piece of code. This text portion is ignored by the compiler/interpreter and is usually considered an understandaing aid to maintainers of the said computer program.

## Example

> Comment your code so in future you or anyone else reading this code would understand why you made such horrible design decisions
> Putting comments in perfectly readable code was something I never understood till I came across Javascript
